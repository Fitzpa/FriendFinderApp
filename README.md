# FriendFinderApp
Welcome to my **friend finder app** where you can take my compatibility quiz to find out which of my friends you will get along with the **most!**
In this project I use the node module *express* to create a server within *node* and deploy the application via *Heroku*

This project demonstrates how and *express* server can be used as well as how a complatibility test you might find on a dating website could work.

## To Use the deployed app:
### * Go to the [FriendFinderApp](https://guarded-cliffs-67953.herokuapp.com/)
## To Work On The Project Yourself:
### * Clone the repo and open it in your code editor.
### * Open your terminal, go to the FriendFinderApp folder and run the command *'npm install'* to load all the node modules and dependencies.
### * Edit the *'friends.js'* file to your liking. 
### * Edit the *'survey.html'* file questions if you want to. 
## Now that you have everything installed and ready to go -
### * Run the command *'node server.js'* in the node terminal.
### * Open your browser to whatever port you are running the app locally on 
### * The find your match!
